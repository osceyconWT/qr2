# CS - Color Storage

welcome to CS! here's a few example images of how this works:<br>
![CS example #1](examples/example1.png)<br>
this reads `hello world!`<br>
![CS example #2](examples/example2.png)<br>
this one reads `the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`<br>
![CS example #3](examples/example3.png)<br>
this one reads the first 100 digits of Ï€. (pi)<br>
and finally, for a very large example,<br>
![CS example #4](examples/example4.png)<br>
this is the first 14,000 digits of pi, only taking up around half of the 100x100 pixel radius.<br>
<br>
you can use my little python script, and hopefully make versions of it in other languages too, to fit your needs.
